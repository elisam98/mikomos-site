The reserve is at an elevation ranging from 2600 to 3000 feet above sea level in the Mojave Desert climate zone. The reserve is administered by California State Parks. The area is one of the state's most consistent poppy-bearing lands. Other wildflowers within the reserve include the owl's clover, lupine, goldfields, cream cups and coreopsis.\n\nThe intense blooming season for the California poppy falls usually within late winter to early spring, during the months of mid-February through mid-May. Blooming seasons are dependent on the amount of rainfall during the winter to early spring seasons. Within the reserve, there are seven miles (10 km) of trails, including a paved section for wheelchair access, which traverse through the poppy fields.

In 1941, a somewhat larger zoo was established on Shmuel Hanavi Street in Jerusalem. This one covered an area of 4.5 dunams (0.45 hectares, or just over one acre). In 1947 the zoo was moved to Mt. Scopus, where the Hebrew University had a plot of land set aside for it. As a result of the evident suffering of the animals during and after Israel's War of Independence in 1948, a decision was made to transfer the zoo once again, this time to a new and larger area of 60 dunams (6 hectares, or just under 15 acres) in Givat Komuna, adjacent to the neighbourhood of Romema. The zoo remained here for 41 years, from 1950 to 1991. During this time it gradually developed into a well-known and beloved attraction. The old zoo closed in 1991, and the process of moving to the new location was begun.\nToday, the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo, as it is still unofficially known, stretches across an area of 250 dunams (25 hectares or 62 acres) in a lovely valley surrounded by green hills and new neighbourhoods. The zoo encircles a small lake situated near the main gate. The lake is fed by a series of pools and waterfalls that flow one into the other. Spacious lawns and shady beauty spots surround the lake and pools. The water system is artificial, and relies on recycled water. The zoo is built on two main levels that house most of the animal exhibits. One main, circular route extends the length of both levels and connects most of the sites on the zoo grounds. Additional side paths also connect the two levels, and exhibits are situated along these paths as well.\nThe zoo reopened in its current location near the southwestern Jerusalem neighbourhood of Manahat (formerly Malkha) in 1993. It was now The Tisch Family Zoological Gardens in Jerusalem - The Biblical Zoo."},{"title":"Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park","id":1495,"categories":["park"],"address":"1200 South Crandon Boulevard.","city":"Key Biscayne","state":"FL","zip":"33149","country":"USA","phone":"3053615811","web_page":"http:\/\/www.floridastateparks.org\/capeflorida\/","coordinates":{"latitude":"25.673611","longitude":"-80.159444"},"basic_description":"Bill Baggs Cape Florida State Park occupies approximately the southern third of the island of Key Biscayne.

The zoo covers an area of 216 acres (874,124 m\u00b2) and houses around 450 species of animals.\n\nBrookfield Zoo, also known as [[Chicago Zoological Park]], opened on July 1, 1934 and quickly gained international recognition for using moats and ditches, instead of cages, to separate animals from visitors. The zoo was also the first in America to exhibit giant pandas. In 1960, Brookfield Zoo built the nation's first fully-indoor dolphin exhibit, and in the 1980s the zoo introduced Tropic World, the first fully-indoor rain forest simulation.\n\nOne of the zoo's most well-known current residents is Binti Jua, a female Western lowland gorilla. On August 16, 1996, a young boy fell into the gorilla exhibit of Tropic World, and Binti Jua carefully cradled the boy and brought him to her trainers. The incident received international attention, inspiring a lively debate as to whether Binti Jua's actions were the result of the training she received from her keepers (who had taught her to bring her own baby, Koola, to zoo curators for inspection) or some instinctive sense of animal altruism.\n\nAnother current resident of the zoo as of 2007 is Cookie, a Major Mitchell's Cockatoo who has been part of the zoo's collection since the opening in 1934, making him at least 72 years old. Cookie was already an adult when the zoo opened, so he may well be older than 72.

Since most were of modest means, the Jews developed a cuisine that was simple yet rich in flavor. Sapore's Chef Ciro Priego learned this traditional technique when he worked for a Jewish Roman Italian family, then introduced it to the rest of the world at Va Bene, a top kosher dairy restaurant in Manhattan. He translated it into modern-day Central Avenue at Sapore in the Five Towns, with a focus on fresh market ingredients that are full of flavor. Every item has been well-researched and only the finest produce is used.\n\nAt Sapore you will find great brick oven pizza prepared in true Italian style and fresh-from-the-water seafood. You'll also find simmering sauces and fresh pastas. You can have all the milk and butter you want, and then some. The food is simple but luxurious; labor-intensive but worth it. According to the owner, \"nobody in today's day is doing such pasta. Nobody makes such bread.\" Indeed, the pasta is homemade and the basket of focaccia and mazza brought to your table can be the start of a new craving. \"People are joyful when they come here,\" he says. \"I had a woman bring in her husband who's an acknowledged carnivore.

Along the park's borders, these streets are usually referred to as Central Park North, Central Park West, and Central Park South, respectively. (Fifth Avenue retains its name along the eastern border.)\n\nIt contains several natural-seeming lakes and ponds, extensive walking tracks, two ice-skating rinks, the Central Park Zoo, the Central Park Conservatory Garden, a wildlife sanctuary, a large area of natural woods, a 106 acre billion gallon reservoir, an outdoor amphitheater which hosts the Shakespeare in the Park summer festival, and grassy areas used for informal or team sports or set aside as quiet areas, as well as playground enclosures for children.

Druid Hill Park is a 745-acre (3.01 km2)  [[wikipedia:urban park|urban park]].The land was originally part of \"Auchentorlie\", the estate of George Buchanan, one of the seven commissioners responsible for the establishment of Baltimore City; Buchanan's country estate included 579 of the 745-acre (3.01 km2) that comprise Druid Hill Park today. Renamed \"Druid Hill\" by [[wikipedia:Nicholas Rogers|Nicholas Rogers]], who married Eleanor Buchanan, it was purchased in 1860 by the city of Baltimore from Lloyd Rogers with the revenue derived from a one-cent park tax on the nickel [[wikipedia:horsecar|horsecar]] fares. Druid Hill Park was inaugurated by Baltimore Mayor [[wikipedia:Thomas Swann|Thomas Swann]] on October 19, 1860.  It is listed on the [[wikipedia:National Register of Historic Places|National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nThe park was designed by Howard Daniels, Baltimore Park Commissioners' landscape designer, and John H. B. Latrobe, who designed the gateways to the park and the alterations made to the early-19th century Nicholas Rogers mansion that already stood in the site. [[wikipedia:George A. Frederick|George A. Frederick]], the very young Baltimore architect who won the commission for [[wikipedia:Baltimore City Hall|Baltimore City Hall]] in 1860, provided designs for architectural features in the park. Among Frederick's playful structures for Druid Hill in Moorish and Chinese styles is the Chinese Station erected in 1864 which were stops on a narrow-gauge railroad that once wound through the park. The \"Mansion House\" now functions as the main administration building of The [[Maryland Zoo|Maryland Zoo]].\n\nLike Central Park, Druid Hill was at the northern edges of urban development at the time of its establishment. The northern end of the park has never been designed as parkland, and stretches of it are fenced off. The southern end of the park was a popular destination for city dwellers for a number of decades.  The park features a number of waterways, most notably Druid Hill Lake, which began construction in 1863 and remains one of the largest [[wikipedia:Earth dam|earthen dam]]med lakes in the country.  With the advent of [[wikipedia:automobile|automobile]]s, the park's many winding roadways became popular with car dealers who took potential buyers there to teach them to drive.\n\nToday many of the fountains and other landscape details are only remnants.\n\nDruid Hill Park is bounded by the [[wikipedia:Jones Falls Expressway|Jones Falls Expressway]] (I-83) to the east, [[wikipedia:Swann Drive|Swann Drive]] and [[wikipedia:Maryland Route 140|Reisterstown Road]] to the west, [[wikipedia:Druid Park Lake Drive]] to the south, and [[wikipedia:Druid Park Drive]] to the north.\n\n==Features==\nToday, the park is home to a number of attractions. These include: \n*The [[Maryland Zoo]]\n*The [[Howard Peters Rawlings Conservatory and Botanic Gardens of Baltimore]], with its historic Palm House and Orchid Room, built in 1888.\n*An 18-hole [[wikipedia:disc golf|disc golf]] course\n*The [[Baltimore Model Safety City]] (where school children learn how to be safe pedestrians by walking in a miniaturized model of downtown Baltimore)[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Druid_Hill_Park&oldid=345709207]","tips":["Not in the best area."],"image":"Baltimore Spring.jpg","caption":"Cherry blossoms along Druid Hill Reservoir."},{"title":"Duck Tours in South Florida","id":2007,"categories":["activity"],"address":"1661 James Ave","city":"Miami Beach","state":"FL","zip":"33139","country":"USA","phone":"3056732217","neighborhood":"South Florida","price":"$32.00 (discount tickets available online)","web_page":"http:\/\/www.ducktourssouthbeach.com\/home2.htm","coordinates":{"latitude":"25.7912216","longitude":"-80.1306333"},"basic_description":"(From their website) \"Now departing from the heart of South Beach, our amphibious vehicles provide a once in a lifetime journey of the famous Miami landmarks before a dramatic \"Splashdown\" into the beautiful Biscayne Bay for a close-up look at the many homes of the \"Rich & Famous\" on Star Island.\n\nSoon after your journey on a Duck tour through South Beach begins, you will quickly realize that you are engaged in an interactive performance that far exceeds your standard tour expectations!\n\nEach tour guide has a background in acting\/comedy to ensure a highly entertaining experience for each passenger complete with jokes, music, plenty of interaction and of course \"quacking\".

Estihana are the names of the owners two young daughters Esther and Hana; hana means flower or petal thereof in Japanese. The flagship establishment in Manhattan opened its doors to the public in December 1996. We are proud to announce the opening of Estihana in Brooklyn.\n\nWhilst the menu is Asian in scope, the food is prepared in the strictest manner of kashrut, approved by Kehilah Kashrus. We at Estihana believe that variety is the keystone of a great meal. Our menu offers culinary creations from Japan, Malaysia, Viet-Nam, and the Canton area of China.\n\nWe offer two types of menus. Some may ask how Japanese cuisine started: In the beginning there was the Sea of Japan. Afterwards the Japanese people of that populated island spent their lives cultivating this renewable food source. Due to the lack of arable land, fish became a staple and rice, which required a great deal of water, joined its ranks. The fusion thereof was a logical consequence. In addition, prior to refrigeration, a means had to be created that would satisfy the need to preserve food. Thus, the origins of sushi. Originally, the rice with vinegar acted as a preservative for the fish. Only in later times did the dish achieve such recognition and following.\n\nOf any Asian meal there are two important components. To attain the harmony of taste, texture, color and aroma we need to balance the principles of Fan and T'sai foods. Fan foods include rice, noodles, grains and the like; whilst vegetables, meat, poultry, and seafood are T'sai foods. Only the very best of fresh and kosher ingredients find their way into our kitchens. You cannot help but notice a unique clarity and distinctiveness of flavor for the food prepared by our world famous chef Ming.\n\nFor the sake of sushi lovers, we serve fine Japanese sake, hot or cold, plum wine, White Zinfandel and Joven (sweet) sparkling wines. In addition, we have red and white wines, which are suitable for meat and chicken dishes.\n\nWe are proud of our food preparation techniques. Each dish is prepared to order using only the freshest of ingredients. Ask questions, then experience a memorable blend of Asian cuisine and American hospitality.\n\nYou are surrounded by a unique environment combining the best influences of Asian and American cultures. As you dine in comfort, enjoying the finest traditions of American hospitality, you are also aware of the mystery and legend of a people thousands of years old. You will notice that Estihana difference!

The national monument area is in the early stages of development and open only on a seasonal basis, so services and facilities are limited.

It is open daily during business hours, for a fee.\n\nThe site's modern history began in 1875 when Elias Jackson \"Lucky\" Baldwin purchased Rancho Santa Anita and constructed its buildings and grounds. The arboretum itself began in 1947 with California and Los Angeles jointly purchasing 111 acres (44.9 ha) to create an arboretum around the Baldwin site. By 1949, the first greenhouse had been constructed and the site's plants inventoried. In 1951, the first 1,000 trees were planted, and in 1956 the arboretum was opened to the public. Ongoing construction of gardens and greenhouses took place during the 1950s and 1960s, and in 1975-1976 the Tropical Greenhouse was opened and the Prehistoric and Jungle Garden completed. Construction and renovation of both greenhouses and gardens has continued to this day.\n\nThe arboretum's plants are grouped by geography with gardens for South American, Mediterranean, South African, Australian and Asiatic-North American plants. Other displays include the Aquatic Garden, Meadowbrook, Demonstration Home Gardens, Garden for All Seasons, Prehistoric and Jungle Garden, Native Oaks, Herb Garden, and the Palm and Bamboo collection. In addition, the arboretum is home to a flock of some 200 peafowl, which are descendants of original birds imported by Baldwin from India in about 1880 (the peafowl is a symbol of the city of Arcadia). Peafowl can also be found throughout neighborhoods surrounding the arboretum.

It was impossible to view the entire gallery space to see if it was entirely covered, for the viewer could only see it from the doorway. The viewer had to either imagine the work or just simply believe that it did exist as described.\n\nThe next earth room was made in Darmstadt, Germany in 1974. Both the first and second earth rooms no longer exist. The third earth room called \"The New York Earth Room\" was commissioned and is maintained by the Dia Center in 1977. This earth sculpture expands 197 cubic meters utilizing 335 square meters of floor space filled to a height of 22 inches. Again, the gallery space had to be reinforced to withstand the total weight of 280,000 lbs. The work is on the second floor of a building at 141 Wooster Street in Soho in New York. To reach the work, you must ascend a very steep staircase. As you move up the stairs, you begin to smell the earth and to feel the humidity that it usually holds. At the top of the stairs is a small foyer where you can look into the first of three rooms.

The Museum and its encircling garden were also designed by Isamu Noguchi. An unusual aspect of the Museum is that it grew out of Noguchi's studio practice. Part of the Museum was Noguchi's studio; many of the Museum's staff members are or were artists and four key staff members served as Noguchi's studio assistants. This has led to a rare relationship of the staff to the Museum \u2013 the staff has an extraordinary familiarity with the collection and understanding of Noguchi's use of materials and of the artist's intention. All are strongly committed to the Museum's mission.\n\nOnce a seasonal museum, the Museum is now open year-round and continues to offer visitors the opportunity to interact with works of art from the permanent collection in an atmosphere of reflection and contemplation. The Noguchi Museum now also organizes changing exhibitions that offer new perspectives on Noguchi's art. This shift in focus enables the Museum not only to show Noguchi as a gifted artist but also to articulate the cultural time in which he worked, the many major cultural figures with whom he engaged and his influence on the art of today. The Museum also offers an expanded series of programs for children, families and a growing general public. The educational programs allow families and children to experience the full breadth of Noguchi\u2019s artistry and vision and to explore the multi-layer meaning of his work, while discovering their own creativity through personal and meaningful art-making projects. The New York State Council on the Arts has recognized the Museum's educational program, Art for Families, as a stellar example of a community outreach program, and Art for Tots as a \u201csuperb approach\u201d in making young children comfortable in a museum setting.\n\nToday, the Museum continues to manage the world\u2019s most extensive collection of Noguchi\u2019s sculptures, architectural models, stage designs, drawings, and furniture designs. It serves the international community by loaning works to other institutions for special exhibitions, organizing traveling exhibitions, and offering scholars access to the artist\u2019s extensive archives, including his correspondence, manuscripts and photographs.

The park contains one of the largest concentrations of Australian Pine trees (an invasive species) found in a Florida State Park.\n\nThe central feature of this park is the mouth of the Oleta River, for which it is named. The river has drawn human inhabitants to the area since about 500 B.C, when its shores served as a campground for Tequesta Indians. It was used by U.S. troops (who called it Big Snake Creek) in 1841 during the Second Seminole War, and further explored in 1881 by Captain William Hawkins Fulford, whose ventured inland to what is now the city of North Miami Beach. The area became more heavily settled in the 1890s and in 1922, developers changed the name from Big Snake Creek to the Oleta River.\n\nThe river itself no longer flows to the Everglades, but remains a popular area for canoeing. The park also boasts some of the best wilderness bike trails in the country, and is a frequent host for triathlons and other extreme sports events.\n\nThere is a beach on Biscayne Bay, kayak rentals, and primitive cabins.[http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Oleta_River_State_Park&oldid=350078662]\n\n(From their website) \"Oleta River State Park offers 15 miles of mountain-bike trails ranging in skill level from novice to advance.

Nice hiking on top.\n\n''From Wikipedia:'' The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway in Palm Springs, California, opened in September 1963 as a way of getting from the floor of the Coachella Valley to near the top of San Jacinto Peak. Prior to its construction, the only way to the top of the mountain was to hike for several hours from Idyllwild.\n\nToday, the tram is one of the biggest attractions in Southern California. The eight-and-a-half-minute ride beginning at the Valley Station up North America's sheerest mountain face passes through several life zones on its way to the mountain station at 8516 feet (2600 m) above mean sea level. The trip has been likened in terms of geologic and climatic change to a motor trip from Sonora to the Canadian tundra.\n\nPassengers disembark at the Mountain Station in the alpine wilderness of Long Valley and Mount San Jacinto State Park. The air can be as much as 40 \u00b0F (25 \u00b0C) cooler at the top than in the desert. Visitors can walk along nature trails, take a burro ride or even play in the snow during the winter months. Back-country hiking can be done with a permit from the U.S. Forest Service. There are two restaurants at the summit. Both stations have gift shops specializing in Aerial Tramway-related merchandise as well as educational toys.\n\nThe view at the top can stretch northward for more than 200 miles (300 km) on a clear day, all the way to Mount Charleston north of Las Vegas. Views to the east and west can stretch as far as 75 miles (120 km); the Salton Sea is plainly visible to the southeast.\n\nA theater with a series of user-selectable presentations is located at the Mountain Station as is a display of taxidermied local fauna, each of which met their ends either by accident or by poaching.

It is located at the west end of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia's [[Fairmount Park]]. The Museum was established in 1876 in conjunction with the Centennial Exposition of the same year. Originally called the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, its founding was inspired by the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum) in London, which grew out of the Great Exhibition of 1851. The Museum, at that time housed in the Centennial Exposition's Memorial Hall, opened its doors to the public on May 10, 1877. While this location was adequate, it was remote from the vast majority of the city's inhabitants.\n\nConstruction of the current building began in 1919 when Mayor Thomas B. Smith laid the cornerstone in a Masonic ceremony on the former reservoir land of the decommissioned Fairmount Water Works covering 10 acres (40,000 m2) of ground. The first section was completed in early 1928. The quasi-Greek Revival design was produced by Horace Trumbauer and the firm of Zantzinger, Borie and Medary. The facade of the building is of Minnesota dolomite. The pediment facing the parkway is adorned with sculptures by C. Paul Jennewein depicting Greek gods and goddesses. There is also a collection of griffins, which were adopted as the symbol of the museum in the 1970s. The Museum's building is fondly nicknamed the Parthenon on the Parkway.\n\nThe institution describes itself as \"one of the largest museums in the United States\", and its collections comprise more than 225,000 objects. Though the Museum houses over 200 galleries spanning 2,000 years, it does not have any galleries devoted to Egyptian, Roman, or Pre-Columbian art. This is because a partnership between the Museum and the University of Pennsylvania had been enacted early in the Museum's history. The University loaned the Museum its collection of Chinese porcelain, and the Museum loaned a majority of its Roman, Pre-Columbian, and Egyptian pieces to the University. However, the Museum keeps a few important pieces for special exhibitions.","image":"Philadelphia Art Museum.jpg","caption":"The front facade of the Philadelphia Museum of Art at night."},{"title":"Philadelphia Zoo","id":1129,"categories":["activity"],"address":"3400 West Girard Ave","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","phone":"2152431100","price":"In-Season - $20 (Winter - $12.95) ; Parking - $15.00","web_page":"http:\/\/www2.philadelphiazoo.org\/","coordinates":{"latitude":"39.975024","longitude":"-75.195544"},"basic_description":"The Philadelphia Zoo, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the west bank of the Schuylkill River, was the first zoo in the United States.

A refined eating area and two private dining rooms (for 30 and 60 people - see photo to your right) welcome you to this world of luxury and serenity. The entrance leads to a full wood-paneled bar. Further inside, guests are seated on 1940s Thonet chairs, as well as elegant banquettes which line the antique white-and-mirrored walls. Iron work, lighted French globes and fresh flowers completes the look.\n\nThe foundation of the cuisine at Prime Bistro is a classic cooking technique paired with local ingredients.\n\nThey serve prime meat with a dry aging process that makes the flesh tender and juicy; you\u2019re more than welcome to take home some raw cuts from their butcher counter and cook it yourself. If you\u2019re eating in, the Asian beef salad is a great start to your meal, as is the Tex Mex appetizer, a smooth and creamy guacamole, cilantro-infused salsa, wontons and hot sauce. For main course it\u2019s hard not to recommend the prime rib for two, a celebratory event as the waiters bring out each layer of the dish. It features crunchy-on-the-outside roasted potatoes, earthy spinach and garlic, three kinds of sauce and a huge plate with a lineup of meat, mushrooms in gravy and a substantial heap of deliciously battered onion rings.","hours":"Sun-Thurs: 12:00pm - 11:00pm \nFriday: 12:00pm - 4:00pm \nSat: 1 hr. after Sabbat - 11pm"},{"title":"Prime Grill","id":445,"categories":["restaurant"],"address":"25 West 56th Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","phone":"2126929292","neighborhood":"Midtown West","price":"$40 - $60","web_page":"http:\/\/www.theprimegrill.com","coordinates":{"latitude":"40.76292","longitude":"-73.9759192"},"cuisine":["American"],"dairy_or_meat":"Meat","hashgacha":"Orthodox Union (OU)","additional_kashrus":"Glatt Kosher","basic_description":"Located in the heart of midtown, an exceptional dining restaurant that happens to be kosher is a good way to describe one of the best kosher restaurants in the country.

A new park named Triangle Park will connect the train station to the arena, making it easily accessible via New Jersey Transit, PATH, Newark Light Rail, and Amtrak.\n\nThe Prudential Center is the first major league sports venue to be built in the New York metropolitan area since the Brendan Byrne Arena, the Devils' former home, opened in 1981.

The ballpark is the home of the [[Staten Island Yankees]], the NY-Penn League affiliate of the [[New York Yankees]], and of [[Wagner College Seahawks]] Baseball. The ballpark was also home of the city\u2019s Pro Cricket team the New York Storm.\n\nRCB Ballpark opened in 2001 and was designed by HOK Sport Venue Event. The design of the ballpark features sails at the entrances due to its location next to the world-famous [[Staten Island Ferry]]. All major local buses and the Staten Island Railway end at the St. George Ferry Terminal, which is less then a five-minute walk from the ballpark. The Ballpark at St. George is more commonly referred to as Staten Island Yankees Stadium instead of its much longer name.\n\nThe site on which the ballpark was built was once the site of the B&O Railroad rail yards for the City of New York, and the current stadium parking lot was the site of Major League Baseball in the 1880s.[citation needed]\n\nRichmond County Bank Ballpark was part of a deal with both the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]] and [[New York Mets]], brokered by then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Due to Major League Baseball territory rules, the Yankees and Mets have veto power over each other (and any other Major League Baseball franchise), if they want to bring an affiliated minor-league team in to the New York City metropolitan area. The Yankees and Mets had attempted to move minor-league teams to the area in the past, only to be turned down with their rival. With help (and public money) from the mayor, both teams agreed to allow each other to have a minor-league team in the city in return for new stadiums. The Mets moved a franchise to a new stadium, called [[KeySpan Park]], in the [[Coney Island]] section of [[Brooklyn]].

They can see far over the plains of Illinois and across Lake Michigan to Indiana, [[MI|Michigan]] and [[WI|Wisconsin]] on a clear day. It takes about 60 seconds to soar to the top in either of two special elevators. The Sears Tower Skydeck competes with the [[John Hancock Center]]'s observation floor a mile and a half away, which is 323 feet (98 m) lower. 1.3 million tourists visit the Skydeck annually.\n\nIn January 2009, the Skydeck began a major renovation which includes the installation of window space which will extend approximately four feet out over Wacker Drive. The new installations will be boxes made entirely of glass, allowing visitors to look through the glass floor to the street 1,353 feet (412 m) below. The idea is based on similar glass bottom attractions at the Grand Canyon and in Australia. The renovation is expected to be complete in April 2009.\n\nA second Skydeck on the 99th floor is used when the 103rd floor is closed.

The former estate covers over 50 acres (200,000 m2), of which 10 acres (40,000 m2) contain the formal botanical gardens. The museum contains over 70 rooms decorated with numerous ancient artifacts but dominated by 15th through early 19th century furnishings and European decorative art.\n\nVizcaya is currently in the midst of a major capital program to refurbish the estate.

It was built in 1914 as Weeghman Park for the Chicago Federal League baseball team, the Chicago Whales. It was also the home of the [[Chicago Bears]] of the National Football League from 1921-1970. It was also called Cubs Park from 1920 to 1926 before finally being renamed for then Cubs team owner and chewing gum industrialist William Wrigley Jr..\n\nLocated in the residential neighborhood of Lakeview, Wrigley Field sits on an irregular block bounded by Clark and Addison Streets and Waveland and Sheffield Avenues. The area surrounding the ballpark contains bars, restaurants and other establishments and is typically referred to as Wrigleyville. The ballpark's mailing address, as many fans of the movie The Blues Brothers know, is 1060 W. Addison Street. During Cubs games, fans will often stand outside the park on Waveland Avenue, waiting for home run balls hit over the wall and out of the park. (However, as a tradition, Cubs fans inside and sometimes even outside the park will promptly throw any home run ball hit by an opposing player back onto the field of play, a ritual depicted in the 1977 stage play, Bleacher Bums, and in the 1993 film, Rookie of the Year.)\n\nWrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by \"Mr. Cub\", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. Since 2006, its capacity has been 41,118, making Wrigley Field the fourth-smallest and most actively used ballpark in 2006. It is the second oldest active major league ballpark (after [[Fenway Park]]), and the only remaining Federal League park. When opened in 1914, Wrigley Field had a seating capacity of 14,000 and cost $250,000 to build.
